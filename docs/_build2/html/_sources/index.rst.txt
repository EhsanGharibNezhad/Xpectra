# Xpectra
for analyzing exoplanetary spectra in the lab, providing insights into atmospheric composition
and habitability. The tasks executed by the ``Xpectra``
modules are outlined below:

``Xpectra`` is a Python package comprising a series of modules, each equipped with specialized machine learning and
statistical capabilities for conducting spectral analysis or Machine Learning (ML) tasks on
molecular and atomic spectra recorded from laboratory spectroscopic measuremtns to understand the atmospheres of extrasolar planets and brown dwarfs.
The tasks executed by the ``Xpectra`` modules are outlined below:


- *SpecMaster module*: Performs various tasks to process the spectra, including:

    - Preparing inputs and outputs
    - Visualizing the data

- *SpecAnalyzer module*: Utilizes different methods/packages such as TensorFlow to:

  - Build Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) model using the training examples
  - Utilize tuned hyperparameters
  - Fit/train the ML models
  - Visualize the loss and training history, as well as the trained model's performance

- *SpecStatVisualizer module*: Implements the following tasks to predict atmospheric parameters:

  - Processes and predicts the observational datasets
  - Deploys the trained ML/CNNs model to predict atmospheric parameters
  - Visualizes the processed observational dataset and the uncertainty in the predicted results



or simply...

 - Load laboratory spectra
 - Follow the tutorials
 - Label the quantum assignments by connecting to the HITRAN database
 - Extract spectroscopic parameters, e.g., line position, pressure-broadening coefficients
 - Report the statistical analysis
